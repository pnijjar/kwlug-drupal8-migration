/**
 * Responsive menu styles.
 *
 * Mixins provide the basic structure and a base style (not much), the rest
 * is up to you, add colors, borders, padding and so on. Icons such as
 * the hamburger and arrows are set in variables in _variables.scss, and you
 * use the color variables for menus from there also.
 *
 * Menu styles are set in Appearance settings using the Responsive Menus extension.
 * There you select a block, breakpoint, a default style and a responsive style.
 * You can safely remove mixins from this file if you not going to use them later
 * on, and want to save a few bytes in stylesheet size.
 *
 * Each mixin takes one or more parameters. Use these to customize the basic
 * structure of the menu, or call options, for example you can place the
 * offcanvas menu on the left or right.
 *
 * Do not import into breakpoints unless you are not using the Responsive Menu
 * settings in Appearance Extensions, in which case you will need to load the
 * at_core/at.responsivemenus library and provide it's required drupalSettings.
 *
 * Breakpoints are handled in matchMedia using Enquire.
 *
 * Responsive styles are a combination of three things:
 *  1. Sass/CSS defined here (with breakpoints etc).
 *  2. jQuery: at.responsiveMenus.js which adds/toggles classes etc.
 *  3. Theme settings as set in your themes extension settings.
