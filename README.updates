HOWTO update Drupal on this system
==================================

Make sure you are in the "kwlug-composer" folder

    composer update --with-dependencies
    cd web
    drush updb

You then need to revert the .htaccess file

    git checkout .htaccess

Finally I guess you check stuff into git?

    git status
    git commit
